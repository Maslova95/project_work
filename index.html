                    <br>I want to note right away that in the fourth generation of headphones, the manufacturer decided to significantly change their sound signature. Now it has become softer and calmer, smoother and more detailed (despite the simplified wireless codec).</br>

                <br>It's now easier than ever to charge and go. You can rest your headphones neatly on a charging pad, and matte silicone piping on the ear cap ensures it won't move around. Spend less time looking for your charger and more time listening to your music. Wireless charging pad is not included.</br>
